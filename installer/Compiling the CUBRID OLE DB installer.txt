Compiling the CUBRID OLE DB installer.txt
==========================================

Introduction
==========================================
The CUBRID OLE DB installer is open-source code, BSD licensed and built using NSIS.
NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) is a professional open source system for creating Windows installers. 
It is designed to be as small and flexible as possible and is therefore very suitable for internet distribution.
(http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page)

We choosed NSIS because it is widely used in open source projects, it is script-based 
and it allows you to create the logic to handle even the most complex installation tasks. 


Updating and compiling the installer
==========================================
The source code for the installer is located in the CUBRID SVN repository:
http://svn.cubrid.org/cubridapis/oledb/branches/RB-9.0.0/Installer - .nsi file(s).

If you want to compile the installer yourself (and maybe change it), we recommend the followings:
- Download the installer script source code - see the above specified location
- Update the instaler script, if needed; we recommend using HM NIS Edit tool (http://hmne.sourceforge.net/).
"HM NIS Edit is the best Editor/IDE for Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS). 
It is useful for both experts and beginners to create setup/installers with the NSIS. 
Its Script Wizard will help you to create standard Setup programs with only a few clicks..." 
- Compile the installer script. (If you use HM NIS Edit it is just a matter of clicking a toolbar button)
